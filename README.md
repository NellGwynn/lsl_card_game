# lsl_card_game

Challenge Playing Card game for community social interaction.  LSL for OpenSim usable in LL Secondlife.

This is a cute "icebreaker" game for social occasions that assigns some arbitrary activity. Ultimately, all it does is match a series of textures (which can be edited) with lines from a notecard so that the textures match the notecard. It is loose and highly configurable, and in groups, best played with a separate "Turn Tracker" module, also available in a separate repo
